Got it, let's analyze the kill feed and the gameplay to count the kills made by the player.

First, check the kill feed entries. The kill feed is in the top right corner. Let's go through each frame:

- In frame 1, the kill feed says "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" - that's a broadcast, not a kill.
- Frame 3: Kill feed shows "Evanlyyy" (probably a typo for Evalyy) with an icon, but need to check who's killed. Wait, the kill feed format: left is killer, right is victim.

Looking for entries where the player's name (Me) is on the left.

Check the kill feed in each frame:

- Frame 5: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" (probably Evalyy) as killer, but what's the victim? Wait, the kill feed in the top right. Let's check:

Wait, the player's name is "Me" in the top right. When a kill happens, the kill feed shows the killer's name on the left, victim on the right.

Let's check the kill feed entries:

Looking at the frames:

- In the first frame, there's a message "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" - not a kill.

- Frame 3: Kill feed shows "Me" as the killer? Let's check. The kill feed in frame 3: "Evalyy" and "DragonSlayer7" maybe? Wait, no.

Wait, the player's name is "Me" in the top right corner. When the player kills someone, the kill feed will have "Me" on the left, victim on the right.

Let's look at the kill feed entries in the frames:

Frame 4: Kill feed says "Evanlyyy" (probably Evalyy) with "DragonSlayer7" - but the player's name is "Me", so if "Me" is the killer, then "Me" would be on the left. Wait, the top right shows the player's team and enemies. The kill feed is in the top right corner, as per standard Valorant.

Let's check the kill feed:

In frame 12 (when the player is moving), the kill feed says "Evanlyyy" (Evalyy) as the killer, but no. Wait, let's check each kill feed:

Wait, the player's name in the kill feed is "Me" (or their handle). Let's see:

Looking at the frames, the kill feed entries:

- Frame 2: Kill feed shows "Evanlyyy" and "DragonSlayer7" - but that's a teammate kill? Wait, no. Wait, the kill feed is top right. Let's check:

In frame 3, the kill feed says "Evalyy" (Evalyy) as the killer, "DragonSlayer7" as the victim. But the player's name is "Me" (player's handle), so if the player is Evalyy, then that's a kill. Wait, the top right corner has the player's info: "Me" with weapon and health.

Wait, the kill feed entries: when the player (Me) kills someone, the kill feed shows "Me [icon] [Victim]".

Looking at the kill feed in the frames:

- Frame 4: Kill feed says "Evalyy" (Evalyy) and "DragonSlayer7" - so Evalyy killed DragonSlayer7. But the player's name is "Me", so if the player is Evalyy, then that's a kill. But is the player Evalyy? Let's check the top right: the player's name is "Me", but their in-game handle is probably "Evalyy" (since in frame 2, the top right shows "Evalyy" as the player).

Wait, in the first frame, the top right shows "Me" (player) with weapon. The kill feed shows "Evalyy" and "DragonSlayer7" - so Evalyy (the player) killed DragonSlayer7. So that's one kill.

Next, another kill: in frame 18, there's a "Blade Storm X ULT READY" and "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED". Then in frame 20, the kill feed might show another kill. Wait, let's check frame 20: the kill feed says "Osamabincapin" (probably Osama) as the killer, but no. Wait, the kill feed in frame 20: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" and "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED". Then frame 21: the kill feed shows "Me" (player) as the killer? Wait, the top right has "Me" as the player's name. Wait, no, the kill feed is in the top right corner, separate from the team info.

Wait, let's look at the kill feed entries:

- In frame 2: Kill feed says "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - so Evalyy killed DragonSlayer7. Since the player is Evalyy (as per top right showing Evalyy as the player), this is a kill by the player.

- Then, in frame 18, there's a "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" and later, in frame 20, the player has a kill. Let's check frame 20: the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer? Wait, the kill feed in frame 20: "Osamabincapin" (left) and "Clove" (right). So Osamabincapin killed Clove. But the player is Me, so if Osamabincapin is the player, then that's a kill. Wait, but in the top right, the player's name is "Me", but the kill feed shows the player's handle. Wait, perhaps the player's handle is "Evalyy", so when they kill, it's Evalyy [victim].

Wait, the key is to check where the player's name is on the left of the kill feed. For example, if the kill feed says "Evalyy [icon] [Victim]", that's a kill by Evalyy.

Looking at the frames:

- Frame 2: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - so Evalyy killed DragonSlayer7. That's one kill.

- Frame 18: The kill feed shows "Me" as the player. Wait, in frame 18, the kill feed says "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" and then in frame 20, there's a kill. Let's check frame 20: the kill feed says "Osamabincapin" (left) and "Clove" (right). So Osamabincapin killed Clove. If the player is Osamabincapin, then that's a kill. But in the top right, the player's name is "Me", but the in-game name is probably "Osamabincapin".

Wait, no, the player's name is the handle. Let's see: in the first frame, the top right has "Me" (player) with weapon, but the kill feed shows the actual handle. So if the player's handle is "Evalyy", then when they kill, the kill feed shows "Evalyy [victim]".

Looking at the kill feed in frame 2: "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - that's a kill by Evalyy (player).

Then, in frame 18, the kill feed says "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED", which is when the player uses their ultimate. Then in frame 20, the kill feed shows "Osamabincapin" (left) and "Clove" (right). But the player's name is Osamabincapin? Wait, the top right shows the player's name as "Me", but in the kill feed, the player's handle is Osamabincapin. Wait, the top right has the player's info: "Me" with weapon, but the kill feed uses the actual name.

Wait, another way: check when the player's health or ammo changes. When the player kills, their ammo decreases or they get a kill streak.

Wait, let's look at the kill feed entries:

- Frame 3: Kill feed says "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - so Evalyy (player) killed DragonSlayer7. That's one kill.

- Frame 19: Kill feed says "Evalyy" (left) and "Clove" (right) - so Evalyy killed Clove. That's another kill.

Wait, in frame 19, the kill feed: "Evalyy [icon] Clove" - yes, that's a kill.

- Frame 20: Kill feed says "Evalyy" (left) and "Clove" (right) - but wait, frame 20 shows "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" and "Blade Storm X ULT READY". Wait, the kill feed in frame 20: is there a kill?

Wait, let's check frame 20: the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "Clove" (right). So another kill.

Wait, no, let's check the kill feed entries step by step.

First frame: no kill feed entry.

Frame 2: kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - kill 1.

Frame 3: kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - wait, maybe not. Wait, the kill feed is the same as frame 2? No, let's check.

Wait, the kill feed entries:

- In the first few frames, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (killer) and "DragonSlayer7" (victim) - that's one kill.

- Then, later, in frame 19, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (killer) and "Clove" (victim) - that's a second kill.

- Then, in frame 21, the kill feed shows "Osamabincapin" (killer) and "Clove" (victim) - but no, the kill feed in frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" and then "Me" (player) as the killer? Wait, no.

Wait, the player is the one who kills, so the kill feed should show the player's name on the left.

Let's check all kill feed entries:

- Frame 2: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left), "DragonSlayer7" (right) - kill 1.

- Frame 3: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left), "DragonSlayer7" (right) - same as before, but maybe a different kill? No, probably a typo.

Wait, no, in frame 3, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right), so that's a kill.

Then, in frame 19, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "Clove" (right) - kill 2.

Then, in frame 21, the kill feed shows "Me" (player) as the killer. Wait, the top right corner shows the player's info as "Me", but the kill feed uses the handle. Wait, the player's handle is "Evalyy", so when they kill, it's "Evalyy [victim]".

Looking at the kill feed in frame 20: there's a kill feed entry that says "Evalyy" (left) and "Clove" (right). That's kill 3?

Wait, let's check the video frames carefully:

Frame 0: No kill feed entry.

Frame 1: Kill feed says "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" - not a kill.

Frame 2: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - kill 1.

Frame 3: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - kill 1 again? No, that's the same kill.

Wait, maybe it's the same kill, so count once.

Frame 4: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - same.

Wait, no, the kill feed entries should be different when different kills happen.

Wait, frame 5: The player has a message: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" - not a kill.

Frame 6: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right) - same as before.

Wait, perhaps the kill feed only shows one kill at the beginning. Let's check frame 17: the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) and "Clove" (right) - that's a kill.

Wait, in frame 17, the kill feed: "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" - so Evalyy (player) killed Clove. That's kill 1.

Frame 18: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" - same, but maybe that's the same kill.

Wait, another kill: frame 20, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" - but Clove is already dead?

Wait, let's check the kill feed entries in detail:

- Frame 2: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "DragonSlayer7" (right) → Kill 1.

- Frame 17: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → Kill 2.

- Frame 19: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same as Kill 2.

Wait, maybe Clove is killed twice, but that's not possible. So probably Kill 2 is Clove, and Kill 1 is DragonSlayer7.

Then, is there a third kill?

Frame 22: Kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same as Kill 2.

Wait, but Clove is killed once. So maybe two kills: DragonSlayer7 and Clove.

Wait, let's check the kill feed in frame 17: the kill feed says "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" → Kill 2.

Then, in frame 19, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" → same kill.

Is there another kill?

Wait, frame 20: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" - that's the player using their ultimate. The kill feed might have a different entry.

Wait, looking at frame 20, the kill feed: "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" → that's the same kill.

Wait, let's check the player's actions:

- The player kills DragonSlayer7 (Kill 1).

- Then, the player kills Clove (Kill 2).

- Then, maybe another kill?

Wait, in frame 22, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" → but Clove is already dead.

Wait, let's count the unique kill feed entries where the player's handle is on the left.

Looking at all frames:

- Frame 2: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "DragonSlayer7" (right) → count 1.

- Frame 17: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → count 2.

- Frame 19: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same as 2, so no new count.

- Frame 20: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same.

- Frame 21: Kill feed: "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same.

Wait, so two distinct kills: DragonSlayer7 and Clove.

Wait, but let's check the kill feed in frame 30: there's a kill feed entry. Wait, no, frame 30 shows the player in a different area.

Wait, another way: count the number of times the player's name is on the left of the kill feed.

From the frames:

- Frame 2: "Evalyy" (left) → kill 1.

- Frame 17: "Evalyy" (left) → kill 2.

- Frame 19: "Evalyy" (left) → same as 2.

- Frame 20: "Evalyy" (left) → same.

- Frame 21: "Evalyy" (left) → same.

- Frame 22: "Evalyy" (left) → same.

So two distinct kills: DragonSlayer7 and Clove.

Wait, but let's check frame 17: the kill feed says "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" → Clove is killed.

Then, in frame 20, the kill feed says "Evalyy" [icon] "Clove" → but Clove is already dead, so that's a mistake, but probably the same kill.

Wait, maybe there's a third kill.

Wait, in frame 25, the player's health is 70, and the kill feed: maybe not.

Wait, looking at the video description:

- The kill feed says "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" → not a kill.

- In frame 3, the kill feed says "Evalyy" (left) "DragonSlayer7" (right) → kill 1.

- In frame 17, the kill feed says "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → kill 2.

- Are there any more?

Wait, in frame 24, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same as kill 2.

So total kills: 2.

Wait, but let's check the kill feed in frame 18: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" → this is when the player uses their ultimate, which might have killed someone. Wait, but the kill feed would show the kill when they land the shot.

Wait, no, the kill feed shows the kill at the moment it happens. So if the player uses their ultimate to kill, the kill feed will show it.

Wait, in frame 18, the kill feed says "Blade Storm X ULT READY" → that's the ultimate being ready. Then, when the ultimate is used (frame 19), the kill feed shows the kill.

So frame 19: kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → kill 2.

Is there a third kill?

Wait, in frame 20, the kill feed shows "Evalyy" (left) "Clove" (right) → same as kill 2.

Wait, but maybe the player killed someone else.

Wait, let's check the video:

At the beginning, the player's team has 9 kills, enemy has 8. After the kills, the score would increase, but the kill feed shows individual kills.

Wait, the kill feed entries:

1. Evalyy killed DragonSlayer7.

2. Evalyy killed Clove.

Are there any other kills?

Looking at frame 1, the kill feed says "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" → not a kill.

Frame 2: Evalyy killed DragonSlayer7.

Frame 17: Evalyy killed Clove.

Is there a kill where the player's name is on the left?

Yes, two kills: DragonSlayer7 and Clove.

Wait, but let's check the player's perspective:

In the video, the player is moving and shooting. When they shoot, enemies fall. The kill feed confirms the kills.

Another way: count the number of times the player's health decreases and the kill feed shows a kill.

Wait, in frame 2, the player's health is 100, and after the kill, it's still 100 (or maybe they took damage from the enemy's shot).

Wait, the kill feed shows two kills: DragonSlayer7 and Clove.

So total kills: 2.
