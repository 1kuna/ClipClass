So, let's analyze the clip step by step. First, we need to identify the player's name from the kill feed. 

Looking at the kill feeds:

- In the early frames, there's a kill feed: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" but that's a broadcast, not a kill.
- Then, when the player (me) kills someone, the kill feed would show "Me" on the left. Let's check the kill feeds:

At around 18-20 seconds, there's a kill feed where the left side has "Me" (the player). Let's check the kill feed entries. Wait, the kill feed entries in the top right:

First, when the player is attacking, the kill feed shows:

- At one point, "Me" is the killer. Let's see:

In the video, when the player shoots, the kill feed should show. Let's check the kill feed messages.

Looking at the kill feeds:

- The first kill: when the player shoots, the kill feed shows "Me" as killer. Let's count:

1. At around 17-18 seconds, the kill feed shows "Me" (player) killing someone. The kill feed entry: "Me" (left) then the victim. Then later, maybe another kill.

Wait, let's check all kill feeds:

- The kill feed entries:

First kill: when the player's name is on the left. Let's check the frames.

At frame 18-19: "Me" is the killer. The kill feed shows "Me" [icon] "DragonSlayer7" (victim). So that's one kill.

Then, later, maybe another kill. Wait, in frame 22-23: kill feed shows "Me" [icon] "Osamabincicappin" (victim). Wait, no, let's check:

Wait, the kill feed format is [Killer] [weapon] [Victim]. The left side of the weapon icon is the killer. So when the player's name is on the left, that's a kill by the player.

Let's check all kill feed entries:

- At around 18 seconds: kill feed shows "Me" (left) with a weapon icon, so that's a kill. Victim is "DragonSlayer7" (or someone).

- Then, later, in frame 22-24: kill feed shows "Me" again? Wait, no, let's check the kill feed entries in the video.

Looking at the video:

- Frame 17-18: kill feed shows "Me" as killer (left side), victim is someone. So that's kill 1.

- Then, at frame 22-23: kill feed shows "Me" as killer (left side), victim is someone. That's kill 2.

Wait, let's check the exact kill feeds:

In the video:

- When the player (me) shoots, the kill feed should show. Let's check:

First kill: The player eliminates a teammate? No, the kill feed shows "Me" as killer. Let's look at the kill feed messages:

In the top right, the kill feed entries:

- At around 18 seconds: "Me" (left) with weapon, so kill 1.

- Then, later, "Me" (left) again, kill 2.

Wait, let's check the kill feed entries in the frames:

Frame 18: The kill feed shows "Me" on the left side. So that's a kill by the player.

Frame 22: Another kill feed where "Me" is on the left.

Wait, but in the video, how many times does "Me" appear as the killer on the left side?

Let's check all kill feed entries:

1. When the player eliminates someone, the kill feed has "Me" as the killer. Let's count:

- First kill: At around 18 seconds, the kill feed shows "Me" as killer. Victim is "DragonSlayer7" (or someone). So that's kill 1.

- Second kill: At around 22-23 seconds, the kill feed shows "Me" as killer. Victim is "Osamabincicappin" (or someone). That's kill 2.

- Third kill? Wait, in the next frame, does it show another kill?

Wait, in the video, let's see the kill feed entries:

- Frame 18: "Me" kills someone (kill 1).

- Frame 22: "Me" kills someone (kill 2).

- Then, the next kill feed: "Me" again? Or another player?

Wait, let's check the frames:

In frame 18, the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right). So kill 1.

In frame 22, the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and "Osamabincicappin" (right). So kill 2.

Is there a third kill?

Looking at the frames:

In frame 30, there's a kill feed: "Clove" (left) but that's a teammate. Wait, no.

Wait, the player's name is "Me" (as seen in the top right corner). So any kill feed entry with "Me" on the left is a kill by the player.

Let's check all kill feed entries:

1. First kill: When the player shoots, kill feed shows "Me" left.

2. Second kill: Another kill feed with "Me" left.

3. Is there a third?

Wait, in frame 15-17, there's a kill feed: "Eva1y" (left) but that's a teammate. So not the player's kill.

Wait, the kill feeds:

- The first kill by the player is when the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and the victim. Let's check the exact moments.

Looking at the video:

- At around 18-19 seconds, the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and "DragonSlayer7" (right). So that's kill 1.

- Then, at around 22-23 seconds, the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and "Osamabincicappin" (right). That's kill 2.

- Later, when the player uses the ability, but then the next kill feed might be another kill.

Wait, in frame 27, the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and "Chamber" (right). Wait, no. Let's check.

Wait, looking at the frames:

At frame 25: the kill feed shows "Me" (left) with a weapon, so that's kill 2. Wait, no, need to check each kill feed.

Wait, the user says to look at the kill feed entries where the player's name is on the left. The player's name is "Me" (since in the top right corner, the name "Me" is shown as the player's name, e.g., "Me" next to the weapon).

Looking at the kill feeds:

1. Frame 18: "Me" is the killer. Victim is "DragonSlayer7".

2. Frame 22: "Me" is the killer. Victim is "Osamabincicappin".

3. Frame 27: Wait, in frame 27, the kill feed shows "Clove" (left), which is a teammate.

4. Is there a third kill?

Wait, in frame 30, the kill feed shows "Clove" (left) and "Me" (right) – no, that's a death.

Wait, let's check all kill feed entries in the video:

- The first kill: when the player shoots, the kill feed shows "Me" as killer.

- Second kill: another "Me" as killer.

- Third kill? Let's see.

Wait, in the video, when the player is moving, there's a kill feed where "Me" is the killer. Let's count:

Looking at the kill feed messages:

1. "Me" [weapon] "DragonSlayer7" – kill 1.

2. "Me" [weapon] "Osamabincicappin" – kill 2.

3. "Me" [weapon] "Chamber" – is there such a kill feed?

Wait, no. Wait, in frame 27-28, there's a kill feed: "Clove" (left) killing someone else, but "Me" is the player, so that's not a kill by the player.

Wait, maybe only two kills.

Wait, let's check the frames again.

In frame 17-19:

- The kill feed shows "Me" killing "DragonSlayer7". So kill 1.

In frame 22-23:

- The kill feed shows "Me" killing "Osamabincicappin". So kill 2.

Any other kill feed with "Me" as the killer?

Looking at frame 30-31:

- The kill feed shows "Clove" (left) killing someone, so that's a teammate's kill.

- Then, "Me" is not the killer.

So total kills: 2.

Wait, but let's check another part.

At frame 18, the player uses the ability "Blade Storm" and kills an enemy. The kill feed shows "Me" as killer.

At frame 22, another kill feed shows "Me" as killer.

So that's two kills.

Wait, but let's confirm.

Kill feed format: [Killer] [icon] [Victim]

In the top right corner, when a kill happens, the kill feed shows the killer's name on the left, then the victim on the right.

So:

- First kill: Killer is "Me" (left), victim is "DragonSlayer7" (right).

- Second kill: Killer is "Me" (left), victim is "Osamabincicappin" (right).

Is there a third?

In the video, when the player is moving to the A site, there's a kill feed where "Me" is the killer. Let's check the frames.

At frame 27, the kill feed shows "Me" (left) and "Chamber" (right). Wait, no, in frame 27-28, the kill feed shows "Clove" (left) and "Chamber" (right). So that's a teammate.

Wait, perhaps only two kills.

Wait, let's count again.

1. First kill: when the player shoots, kill feed shows "Me" on the left.

2. Second kill: when the player uses the ability and kills, kill feed shows "Me" on the left.

3. Third kill: ?

Looking at the video:

- At 18 seconds: kill feed shows "Me" (left) killing someone. That's kill 1.

- At 22 seconds: kill feed shows "Me" (left) killing someone. That's kill 2.

- At 26 seconds: the kill feed shows "Clove" (left), so not the player.

- At 28 seconds: kill feed shows "Clove" again.

- At 30 seconds: kill feed shows "Clove" (left), and the player is dead? No.

So total kills: 2.

Wait, but wait in frame 22-23, the kill feed shows "Me" as killer, so that's kill 2.

Yes, so the answer should be 2.
