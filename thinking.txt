Got it, let's analyze the video frame by frame to count the player's kills.

First, look at the kill feed and notifications. Let's check each part:

- At timestamp 3.5s (approx), there's a notification: "evil Eliminated - Team". That's a kill by the player (since the player is the one with the gun, and this is a teammate? Wait, no, the player is on their own team. Wait, the kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team" so maybe the player's teammate killed "evil"? Wait, no, the player's character—wait, the kill feed at the bottom left says "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" but then later, in the kill feed, when a kill happens, it's a notification. Wait, let's check:

In frame 0, there's a kill feed saying "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A". Then at frame 4.5, the notification says "evil Eliminated - Team". Wait, "evil" is probably the enemy team's player. So the player's team (Clove's team) eliminated "evil" (enemy). So that's one kill.

Then, looking at the scores: the score goes from 9-8 to 9-9? Wait, no, the initial score is 9-8. Then when a kill happens, the score updates. Let's check the top bar:

At the start, 9-8. Then when "evil Eliminated", the score would go to 10-8? Wait, no—wait, the kill feed says "evil Eliminated", so if the player's team is the one with the 9, then eliminating an enemy (evil) would make it 10-8. Wait, but in the video, the score starts at 9-8. Let's check the timeline.

Wait, the first kill: when the player (Clove) spots an enemy, then the enemy is eliminated. Let's check the kill feed. In frame 4, there's "evil Eliminated - Team" (the -Team probably indicates the player's team killed them). So that's one kill.

Then, later, when the player uses Blade Storm (ULT), there's a kill. Let's see:

At frame 19-20, the player uses the ULT (Blade Storm). Then in frame 22, there's a "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" and then an elimination. Wait, the kill feed at frame 20: "Blade Storm X ULT READY". Then at frame 23, the kill feed says "HubbyMadeMeGetOn" (player name?) and then the kill. Wait, let's check the kill feed:

Looking at the top right corner, the kill feed shows kills. Let's check each kill:

1. When the enemy "evil" is eliminated (notification at frame 4), that's one kill.

2. Then, when the player uses Blade Storm (frame 19), they probably get another kill. Let's check the score: initially 9-8. After the first kill, score becomes 10-8 (since the enemy team lost a player). Then later, another kill. Wait, let's check the kill feed again.

Wait, the kill feed messages:

- Frame 4: "evil Eliminated - Team" → kill 1.

- Later, when the player uses Blade Storm, the kill feed might show another kill. Let's look at frame 19-20: after using Blade Storm, there's a kill. The score goes from 9-8 to 9-9? Wait, no. Wait, the kill feed:

Another point: when the player eliminates an enemy, the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer. Let's check:

At frame 19, when the player shoots an enemy, the kill feed shows "Me" (player) killing someone. Let's see:

In frame 18, the score is 9-8. Then, after a kill, the score becomes 9-9 (since the other team lost a player). Wait, but the score on the top bar: the first team has 9, the second has 8. If they kill an enemy, the second team's count goes down, so 9-7? Wait, no. Wait, in Valorant, when a kill happens, the team that kills (the attacking team) gets a point. Wait, no—Valorant's scoreboard: the team with the higher number is the one with more kills. So if the score is 9-8, that means the team with 9 kills is ahead. So if the player (part of the team with 9) kills an enemy, that enemy is from the team with 8, so their count becomes 7, making the score 10-7? Wait, no—actually, each kill increases the team's score by 1. So if the score was 9-8, and a kill happens (enemy from the 8 team is killed), then the score becomes 10-8.

Wait, let's check the kill feed. In the video, the kill feed has notifications like "evil Eliminated - Team". So the player's team killed "evil", which is an enemy player. So that's a kill.

Then, when the player uses Blade Storm, they probably kill another enemy. Let's check the kill feed:

At frame 20, the player's team score is 9, enemy 8. Then after a kill, the score is 10-8. Then another kill, score 11-8? But wait, the kill feed:

Looking at frame 30, there's a kill feed notification: "Clove Eliminated - Team" (which is a kill by the player's team, but "Clove" is the player's name, so the player is killed? Wait, no—wait, the kill feed says "Clove Eliminated - Team" which would be the player's team killed Clove, but that's not right. Wait, no—the player is Clove, so if Clove is eliminated, it's a kill on the player. But in this clip, the player is alive. Wait, the text at frame 0: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — so Clove is the player.

Wait, maybe the kill feed:

Let's check each kill:

1. The first kill: the player's teammate (since Clove is the player) kills "evil". Wait, no—the kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team", so the player's team killed "evil". So that's one kill.

2. Then, when the player uses Blade Storm (ultimate ability), they get another kill. Let's see the score: after the first kill, the score is 9-8 → 10-8. Then another kill, score 11-8.

But let's count the kill notifications:

- At timestamp 4s: "evil Eliminated - Team" → kill 1.

- At timestamp 20s: after using Blade Storm, there's a kill. Let's check the score: the top bar shows 9-8 → after kill, 10-8? Wait, no. Wait, the score in the video:

Wait, the top bar in the first frame is 9-8. Then when a kill happens, the score changes. Let's check:

After the first kill (evil eliminated), the score would be 10-8. Then another kill, 11-8, etc.

But let's count the kill notifications on the screen:

- The kill feed has messages like "evil Eliminated - Team", which is one kill.

- Then, when the player uses Blade Storm, they eliminate another enemy. Let's check the kill feed: there's a message "HubbyMadeMeGetOn" — wait, no, the kill feed might list the killer's name. Wait, in Valorant, the kill feed shows "Player (Team) eliminated enemy".

Wait, let's check the exact frames:

At frame 4.5s: "evil Eliminated - Team" → that's a kill by the player's team (so player or teammate). Since the player is Clove, and the kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team", it's likely the player's team killed them. So that's one kill.

Then, later, at frame 19.5s, when the player uses Blade Storm, they get a kill. Let's check the kill feed: there's a message "Me" as the killer? Or the kill feed shows another kill.

Wait, in frame 18, the player has 77 health, then uses Blade Storm, and in frame 20, there's a kill. Let's check the kill feed: "Clove Eliminated" is not a kill on the player. Wait, the kill feed at frame 19: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — that's the player's ultimate ability. Then in frame 20, the kill feed shows "Me" (player) killing someone. Wait, the text at the top right: when a kill happens, it shows "Me" as the killer.

Wait, let's check the kill feed:

- Frame 4: "evil Eliminated - Team" → kill 1.

- Frame 19-20: The player uses Blade Storm, then kills an enemy. The kill feed would show "Me" as the killer. Let's check:

At frame 20, the kill feed says "Me" (player) killed someone. So that's kill 2.

Wait, but let's check the score. The initial score is 9-8. After two kills, it would be 11-8. Let's check the score in the video:

In frame 18, the score is 9-8. Then after the second kill (at frame 20), the score would be 10-8. Wait, no. Wait, the first kill makes it 10-8 (since the enemy team's score was 8, now 7). Then the second kill makes it 11-8.

But how many kills does the player have? Let's check the kill feed notifications that attribute the kill to the player.

Wait, the kill feed in the top right corner:

- At frame 4: "evil Eliminated - Team" → this is a kill by the player's team (so the player or teammate). But the player's team is the one with the 9 score, so the enemy team is 8. When they eliminate an enemy, the enemy team's count drops to 7. So the score becomes 10-8.

- Then, later, when the player uses Blade Storm (ultimate), they eliminate an enemy. The kill feed would show the player's name (e.g., "Clove" or "Me") as the killer.

Wait, in the video, let's check the kill feed messages:

- The first kill: "evil Eliminated - Team" → that's a kill by the player's team.

- The second kill: when the player uses Blade Storm, there's a notification "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" and then a kill. The kill feed shows "Me" as the killer.

Wait, in frame 19: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" (player's ultimate is ready), then in frame 20, the player uses the ultimate, and the kill feed shows "Me" killing an enemy. So that's a kill.

Wait, also, there's a kill at frame 24: the kill feed shows "HubbyMadeMeGetOn" — but that's another player on the team.

Wait, no—let's count the distinct kill confirmations where the player is the one who killed:

1. The first kill: "evil Eliminated" (player's team, so player's kill). Wait, is "evil" the player's kill? The player's team's kill. If the player is on the team, it's possible.

2. The kill when the player uses Blade Storm (ult): that's a direct kill by the player.

3. Any other kills?

Wait, let's check the health bar: when the player shoots an enemy, there's a kill marker. For example, at frame 16, the player shoots an enemy, and the enemy dies (hit marker). Then, at frame 18, the enemy is eliminated (health bar drops to 0).

Wait, let's go step by step:

- Frame 0-2: The player is in a corridor, sees an enemy (Clove) spotted enemy. The enemy is about to be shot.

- Frame 3: The player's teammate shoots the enemy (evil), and the enemy is eliminated (kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team"). So that's kill 1.

- Then, the player moves towards the enemy's position.

- At frame 18: The player uses Blade Storm (ult) and kills an enemy. The kill feed shows the kill. Let's check: the kill feed at frame 19 shows "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED", then at frame 20, the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer. So that's kill 2.

Wait, but is that two kills?

Wait, let's check the kill feed notifications:

1. "evil Eliminated - Team" → kill 1.

2. "Me" (player) eliminating someone → kill 2.

Wait, but is there a third kill?

At frame 24, the kill feed shows "Clove Eliminated - Team" — but that's the player being killed, which is a death, not a kill. So that's a death.

Another check: the score.

Initial score: 9-8.

After kill 1: score becomes 10-8.

After kill 2: score becomes 11-8.

But does the player have two kills?

Wait, let's check the kill feed messages again:

- Frame 4: "evil Eliminated - Team" → kill 1.

- Frame 19-20: "Blade Storm X ULT READY", then after using the ult, there's a kill. The kill feed would show the kill. Let's see the top right corner:

At frame 20, the kill feed says "Me" (player) killed someone. So that's kill 2.

Is there a third kill?

Let's check frame 30: there's a kill feed notification "Clove Eliminated" — which is the player being killed, so that's not a kill by the player.

Another possibility: when the player shoots the enemy in frame 20, that's a kill. Then another kill.

Wait, the player's health goes down: at frame 18, health is 77, then after the ult, health goes to 70. So there's a kill (the enemy is eliminated), but the player's health is still high.

Wait, let's count the number of enemy deaths caused by the player:

- The first enemy killed (evil) is done by the player or teammate. The kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team", so it's the team, which includes the player.

- The second kill is done by the player using Blade Storm.

Wait, but maybe the first kill is done by the player. Let's see: in frame 2, the player's teammate shoots the enemy, and the enemy is eliminated. So that's a teammate kill.

Wait, the player is the one holding the gun, but maybe they are not the one who shot. Let's check the kill feed: "evil Eliminated - Team" — so the team eliminated "evil", but who was the killer? The player or a teammate.

Then, later, the player uses Blade Storm and kills an enemy. So that's another kill.

Wait, but how many kills does the player personally have?

In Valorant, when you kill an enemy, you get a kill. The kill feed shows "Me" as the killer if you're the one who killed.

So let's check for "Me" in the kill feed:

- At frame 19-20: when the player uses Blade Storm, the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer. So that's one kill.

- Are there other times when "Me" is the killer?

At frame 0-2, the player spots an enemy, but no kill.

At frame 3, the teammate kills the enemy (kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team", not "Me"), so that's a teammate kill.

At frame 18-20, the player uses Blade Storm and the kill feed shows "Me" as the killer.

Is there another kill where "Me" is the killer?

Wait, let's check the score: the initial score is 9-8. After two kills by the player (Me), the score would be 11-8. But let's check the video's top bar:

At frame 0, score is 9-8.

At frame 19, score is still 9-8? No, because kills happen. Wait, no—when a kill happens, the score updates. For example, if the player's team kills an enemy, the score increases by 1.

But in the video, the top bar shows 9-8 initially. After kill 1, it's 10-8. After kill 2, it's 11-8.

But let's look at the kill feed messages:

- First kill: "evil Eliminated - Team" → team kill (1 kill).

- Second kill: "Me" (player) kills someone → 2 kills.

Is there a third kill?

Wait, the player's health: at frame 19, health is 77, then after using the ult, health is 70. That's a kill (enemy down), so that's one kill.

But wait, when the player uses Blade Storm, it's a team ability that might kill multiple enemies. But in the video, the player uses it, and there's a kill.

Wait, but let's count all kill notifications where the killer is "Me" or the team:

- "evil Eliminated - Team" → team kill (1).

- "Me" (player) kills → 2.

- Any other "Me" kills?

No, the other kills are team kills. So the player has two kills?

Wait, but wait: the first kill is done by the team, but is the player the one who did it? In Valorant, when the kill feed says "Team", it could be any player on the team. But the player is Clove, so maybe they are the one who killed.

Wait, but the kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team", so it's possible that the player (Clove) killed evil.

Then, the second kill is also done by the player.

But let's check the frames:

Frame 3: The player's character (Clove) is in the corridor, and the enemy "evil" is killed. The kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team", which could mean the player killed him.

Frame 19: The player uses Blade Storm (ult), and kills another enemy. The kill feed shows "Me" as the killer.

So that's two kills.

Wait, but in frame 18, when the player shoots an enemy, the enemy's health is reduced, and the kill feed shows the enemy dying. Let's check the score:

At frame 0, score is 9-8.

After the first kill, score is 10-8.

After the second kill, score is 11-8.

But the top bar in the video at frame 19 shows 9-8. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe the score is 9-8, and the kill feed is the kill for the 9th kill? No, the score is the number of kills by each team.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's count the kill feed notifications where the killer is "Me" or the player:

1. "evil Eliminated - Team" → team kill. The player could be the one.

2. "Me" (player) as the killer → another kill.

Is there a third kill?

Wait, when the player uses Blade Storm, maybe it kills multiple enemies. But the kill feed would show multiple kills.

Wait, the problem says "count the kills made by the player in this first-person gaming clip".

In Valorant, a kill is when the player eliminates an enemy. So:

- The first kill: the player (or a teammate) kills an enemy. If the player is the one who shot, then it's a kill.

- The second kill: the player uses Blade Storm and kills another enemy.

Let's check the kill feed:

- At frame 4: "evil Eliminated - Team" → kill 1.

- At frame 20: "Me" (player) as the killer → kill 2.

- Is there a third kill?

Wait, in frame 28, the kill feed shows "Clove Eliminated - Team" — which is a kill on the player, so that's a death, not a kill.

Another check: the player's character dies in frame 29 (Clove eliminated), so that's not a kill.

So the only kills by the player are the two mentioned.

Wait, but wait: in frame 3, the enemy is killed by the player's teammate, so that's not a player kill. Then, when the player uses Blade Storm, that's a player kill.

Wait, how to determine if the first kill is by the player:

At frame 2, the player's character is holding the gun, and moves towards the enemy. At frame 3, the enemy (evil) is eliminated. The kill feed says "evil Eliminated - Team". So it's the team's kill. But the player is on the team, so it's a team kill. But was it the player who did it?

In the video, the player is moving towards the enemy, and the enemy is killed. Maybe the player is the one who shot.

Wait, the gameplay: the player's view shows the enemy being shot. Let's check the bullet trajectory.

In frame 3, the player's gun is firing towards the enemy, and the enemy's health is reduced.

Yes, in frame 3, the player (Clove) is shooting the enemy "evil", so that's a kill by the player. So that's kill 1.

Then, later, when the player uses Blade Storm (ult), they kill another enemy (kill 2).

So total kills: 2.

Wait, but let's check the kill feed again:

- Kill 1: "evil Eliminated - Team" → the player's kill.

- Kill 2: "Me" (player) killed another enemy.

Yes, that's two kills.

But wait, in the video, when the player uses Blade Storm, it's a skill that might kill multiple enemies. But the kill feed shows one kill.

Wait, the top bar: the score is 9-8, and after two kills, it's 11-8.

But let's count the kill notifications:

1. "evil Eliminated" → kill 1.

2. "Me" killed → kill 2.

Yes, two kills.

Is there a third kill?

Let's check frame 25: the kill feed shows "HubbyMadeMeGetOn" — but that's another player on the team, so it's a team kill, but not the player.

Another possibility: when the player is using the ultimate, it causes a kill, which is kill 2.

So the player made two kills.
