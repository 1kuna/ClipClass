So, let's go through each frame step by step.

First, check the kill feed entries. The kill feed is in the top-right corner. Let's look for entries where the left side (killer) is the player's name.

Looking at the frames:

- Frame 0: Kill feed shows "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A". That's a broadcast, not a kill.
- Frame 2: "evl Eliminated - Team" — that's a teammate? Wait, the kill feed format: left is killer, right is victim. Wait, the example says "Kill feed format: [Killer] [weapon/ability icon] [Victim]". So the left of the icon is killer, right is victim.

Wait, in the top-right corner, the kill feed. Let's check each frame.

Frame 0: Kill feed says "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

Frame 1: Kill feed shows "evil Eliminated - Team" — maybe? Wait, the name on the left. Let's check:

Wait, the kill feed entries are displayed as "[Killer] [weapon] [Victim]". So for example, if a kill happens, it's "Player1 (gun) Player2".

Looking at the frames:

In frame 0: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

Frame 2: The kill feed says "evl Eliminated - Team" — but "evl" might be a teammate? Wait, no, the kill feed entry for a kill would have the killer's name on the left. Let's check the kill feed entries in each frame.

Wait, in frame 1 (second frame), the kill feed shows "evl Eliminated - Team" — but "evl" is the killer? Wait, "evl Eliminated - Team" — maybe "evl" is the killer, and the victim is Team? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's "evl" (killer) eliminated "Team" (victim). But in the game, kill feed entries are usually "[killer] [weapon] [victim]".

Wait, looking at frame 3: The kill feed says "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — no. Frame 4: Kill feed shows "evl Eliminated - Team" — again, "evl" as killer. But wait, in the context of the video, the player in first-person is Clove? Wait, no. Wait, the player in first-person has a weapon, and the kill feed entries.

Wait, the first-person view: the player's name is in the top-right corner. Let's check the top-right corner where it says "Me" — the player's name. For example, in the first frame, it says "Me Me" — no, wait, the top-right corner: "Me" followed by the name. Wait, in frame 0: "Me" with "Me" next to it? No, looking at frame 0:

Top-right corner: "Me" (player's name), "sword" (weapon), "Takis" (teammate). Wait, the kill feed entries are in the top-right corner. Let's check each frame's kill feed.

Frame 0: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 2: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer? Or is "evl" the victim? Wait, "Eliminated - Team" — maybe "evl" killed a teammate? No, teammates are "Team", but "Team" might be a team name. Wait, no, in Valorant, kill feed entries are [killer] [weapon] [victim]. So for example, "PlayerA (gun) PlayerB".

Looking at frame 1 (second frame), the kill feed says "evl Eliminated - Team" — but that's not a kill feed entry. Wait, perhaps the kill feed entries are the ones with the weapon icons. Let's check the frames where there's a kill.

In frame 19: The kill feed shows "Clove" (player's name?) — no. Wait, let's check each frame for kill feed entries with the player's name.

Wait, the player's name in the first-person view: the top-right corner shows "Me" with the player's name. Let's check the top-right corner in each frame.

Frame 0: "Me" (player's name), then "Takis" (teammate). The kill feed entry is "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 1: The kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — but what's the killer's name? "evl" — if "evl" is the player's name, then that's a kill. Wait, no, the player's name in the top-right corner is "Me" — so the player's name is "Me" (the player's in-game name). Wait, no, in the top-right corner, it shows the names of players. For example, in frame 0: "Me" (player), "Takis" (teammate), "evl" (enemy?), etc.

Wait, the kill feed entries are in the top-right corner. Let's look for entries where the killer's name is the player's name.

Looking at frame 4: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer? Or is "evl" the victim?

Wait, in Valorant, the kill feed is formatted as: [killer] [weapon] [victim]. So for example, "Clove (Vandal) Osamu" — Clove is the killer, Vandal is the weapon, Osamu is the victim.

So in the kill feed entries, the name on the left is the killer, the name on the right is the victim.

So we need to find entries where the left name is the player's name (the player in first-person view).

How do we know the player's name? The player's name is in the top-right corner where it says "Me". For example, in the frames, the top-right corner has "Me" followed by the player's in-game name.

Let's check frame 0: top-right says "Me" (player's name) with "sword" (weapon), "Takis" (teammate). The kill feed in the top-right corner (the kill feed window) has "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 2: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer? Because "Eliminated - Team" would mean "evl" eliminated someone from Team (but Team is the team, not a player name). Wait, no, "Team" is probably the team, but the victim is "Team" — that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's "evl" (killer) eliminated "Takis" (victim). Wait, the kill feed entries are often [killer] [weapon] [victim].

Looking at frame 1: the kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — but maybe it's "evl" killed "Takis" (since Takis is a teammate). Wait, the player's name is "Me", so if there's a kill where the killer is "Me", then it's a kill by the player.

Wait, let's check the kill feed entries in each frame where there's a kill.

Frame 4: The kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — but this is a teammate elimination (since Team is the team name). Wait, no, in Valorant, kill feed entries are for individual players. So "evl" is a player name (enemy), "Takis" is a teammate.

Wait, let's check the kill feed entries in frames where there's a kill.

Frame 19: The kill feed shows "Clove" (player's name?) — no, in frame 19, the kill feed entry is "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — that's an ability charge, not a kill.

Frame 21: The kill feed shows "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 29: The kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — but "Clove" is the killer, so if the player's name is "Clove", then that's a kill.

Wait, the player in first-person view: the weapon is Clove's weapon. Wait, the first-person view has a weapon with the name "Clove" on the HUD. Wait, in frame 0, the player's weapon is "Clove", but in the top-right corner, the kill feed.

Wait, maybe the player's name is "Clove". Let's check the top-right corner where it says "Me" — "Me" is the player's name, but in the kill feed, the killer's name is "Clove". Wait, no, in the top-right corner, it's "Me" with the player's in-game name. Let's check frame 0: top-right corner has "Me" (player's name), then "sword" (weapon), "Takis" (teammate), "evil" (enemy). The kill feed in the top-right corner (the kill feed window) has "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 1: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer? If "evl" is the player's name, then yes. But the player's name is "Me", so "evl" is a teammate or enemy.

Wait, maybe the player's name is "Clove" as per the weapon. Because the weapon in the first-person view is "Clove", which is a Valorant agent. Wait, no, the weapon is a Vandal or other gun. Wait, the weapon in the first-person view is a gun with a blue design, and the HUD says "Clove" — maybe that's the agent name. Wait, the player is playing as Clove, so their in-game name is Clove.

Ah, yes! In Valorant, the player's in-game name is the agent they're playing as. So if the player is Clove, then their name is Clove.

Looking at the kill feed entries: if the left side of the kill feed entry is Clove, then that's a kill by the player.

Let's check each frame for kill feed entries where the killer is Clove.

Frame 0: Kill feed shows "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast, not a kill. So no kill here.

Frame 2: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer? Or is it "Takis" as the victim? Wait, "evl Eliminated - Team" — this might be "evl" killed "Team" (but Team is the team name, not a player). So no.

Frame 4: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — same as above.

Frame 19: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — again a broadcast.

Frame 21: Kill feed entry: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 29: The kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — but "Clove" is the killer, so if "Clove" is the player's name, then that's a kill. Wait, "Clove Eliminated - Team" — maybe "Clove" killed someone in Team (but Team is the team). Alternatively, "Clove" eliminated "Takis" (the teammate's name). Wait, the kill feed format is [killer] [weapon] [victim]. So "Clove (Vandal) Takis" — Clove killed Takis.

Wait, in frame 29, the kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — but maybe it's "Clove" (killer) killed "Takis" (victim). Let's check the frames.

Wait, in frame 29: the kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team". Wait, "Eliminated" would mean the victim is eliminated. So "Clove" killed someone in the Team. But Team is the team name, so the victim is a teammate. But in the kill feed, the victim is usually the player's name. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, or the team name is "Team". But if the player is Clove (killer), then the kill count increases.

But let's check when the kill feed has the player's name as the killer.

Looking at frame 21: the kill feed shows "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 19: the kill feed shows "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — not a kill.

Frame 17: the kill feed shows "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer.

Wait, the player in first-person is the one with the blue weapon, which is Clove's ability. Wait, Clove is an agent who has a melee weapon, but in this clip, the player is using a gun.

Wait, maybe the player's name is "Clove" as shown in the top-right corner. Let's check the top-right corner in frame 0: "Me" (player), then "Takis" (teammate), "evil" (enemy). The kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — so "Clove" is the name of the player (the agent), so the player's name is Clove.

So any kill feed entry where the killer is "Clove" is a kill by the player.

Looking at the kill feed entries:

Frame 0: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast, not kill.

Frame 2: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is "evl", not Clove.

Frame 4: Same as frame 2.

Frame 8: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 10: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 12: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 14: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is "evl".

Frame 16: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — same as above.

Frame 19: Kill feed entry: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — ability charge.

Frame 21: Kill feed entry: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — ability charge.

Frame 23: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 25: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is "evl".

Frame 27: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast.

Frame 29: Kill feed entry: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — but this is "Clove" (killer) eliminated "Team" (victim). But "Team" is the team, so it's likely that "Clove" killed a teammate, which would be a kill but for teammates (but in Valorant, you can't kill teammates unless it's a mistake). Wait, no, the kill feed shows kills against enemies. So if it's a kill by Clove, it's against an enemy.

Wait, but in the kill feed entries, the killer's name should be Clove if it's the player.

Wait, let's look at the frames where there are kills.

In frame 1 (second frame): the player (Clove) shoots an enemy. The kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team". If "evl" is the player's name, then it's a kill by the player. But "evl" is probably the player's name.

Wait, the player's name in the top-right corner is "Me", but the kill feed entries have "evl" and "Clove". Maybe "Clove" is the player's name.

Wait, let's count the kill feed entries where the killer's name is Clove.

Looking at the frames:

- Frame 0: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

- Frame 2: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is killer.

- Frame 4: Same as frame 2.

- Frame 8: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

- Frame 10: Same as above.

- Frame 12: Same.

- Frame 14: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is killer.

- Frame 16: Same as above.

- Frame 19: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — not a kill.

- Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

- Frame 23: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

- Frame 25: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is killer.

- Frame 27: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

Wait, but when the player kills an enemy, the kill feed entry should show the player's name as the killer. But in this clip, I don't see any kill feed entries where the killer is the player (Clove or Me).

Wait, but the player is playing as Clove, so their name is Clove. Let's check frame 19: the kill feed shows "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast.

Wait, maybe there's a kill in frame 20. Let's check frame 20: the player (Clove) is moving, and the kill feed shows "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — again a broadcast.

Wait, but the player is supposed to be killing enemies. Let's look for the kill feed entries.

In frame 17: the player is shooting, and the kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer. If "evl" is the enemy, then it's not a kill by the player.

Wait, the player's name is in the top-right corner. Let's check the top-right corner in frame 0: "Me" (player's name) is visible, along with "Takis" (teammate) and "evil" (enemy).

So the player's name is "Me", but the kill feed entries have names like "evl" and "Clove".

Wait, maybe "Me" is the player's name, so in the kill feed entries, the left side is the killer. So if the left side is "Me", that's a kill by the player.

Let's check:

Frame 0: Kill feed entry is "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove", not "Me".

Frame 1: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl", not "Me".

Frame 2: Same as above.

Frame 3: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 4: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 5: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 6: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 7: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 8: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 9: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 10: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove", not "Me".

Frame 11: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove".

Frame 12: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 13: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 14: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 15: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 16: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 17: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 18: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 19: Kill feed entry: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — not a kill.

Frame 20: Kill feed entry: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 21: Kill feed entry: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 22: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove".

Frame 23: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove".

Frame 24: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove".

Frame 25: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 26: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — left is "evl".

Frame 27: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove".

Frame 28: Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — left is "Clove".

Frame 29: Kill feed entry: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — left is "Clove".

Wait, but when the kill feed entry shows the player's name as the killer, that's a kill. So if the player's name is "Clove", then any entry with "Clove" on the left is a kill.

But in the frames, how many times does "Clove" appear as the killer?

Looking at the kill feed entries:

- Frame 0: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 10: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 11: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 22: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 23: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 24: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 27: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 28: "Clove" (left) in broadcast.

- Frame 29: "Clove" (left) in kill feed entry.

But these are broadcasts (spotted an enemy), not actual kills.

Actual kills are when the kill feed shows the player's name as the killer with the victim's name.

Wait, in the kill feed, a kill entry would be "Player1 (gun) Player2". So the left side is Player1 (killer), right side is Player2 (victim).

So if the player's name is "Clove", then any kill entry with "Clove" on the left is a kill.

Let's look for kill feed entries where the left side is "Clove" and the right side is a victim (not "Team" or broadcast).

Wait, in the frames:

Frame 0: Broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 1: "evl Eliminated - Team" — victim is "Team", so not a player (since Team is the team name).

Frame 2: Same as frame 1.

...

Frame 29: Kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this would be Clove (killer) eliminated Team (victim). But Team is the team, so it's likely that "Team" is a typo for a player name, but in Valorant, team names are "Terrorist" or "Counter-Terrorist", not "Team".

Wait, maybe "Team" is a player's name. For example, if the victim is "Takis" (teammate), then "Clove Eliminated - Takis" would be a kill.

But in the kill feed, it's shown as "Clove (gun) Takis".

Wait, looking at frame 0, the kill feed entry is "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — so the enemy is spotted, but not killed.

Now, let's check the rounds. The score is 9-8, so the round is not over.

But when does the player kill an enemy?

In frame 2, the player is shooting an enemy (the green silhouette). If the enemy is eliminated, the kill feed should show "Clove (gun) Enemy".

But in the kill feed entries, it's shown as "evl Eliminated - Team" — "evl" is the killer, so if "evl" is the enemy, then it's not the player's kill.

Wait, maybe the player is not making kills. Let's count the kill feed entries where the left side is the player's name.

But the problem says to count all kills made by the player.

Let's look for the kill feed entries where the player's name is the killer.

In the top-right corner, the player's name is shown. For example, in frame 0, the player's name is "Me", but the kill feed entries have names like "Clove" and "evl".

Wait, perhaps the player's name is "Me", so the kill feed entries where the killer is "Me" are kills.

Let's check:

Frame 0: Kill feed entry: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — killer is Clove.

Frame 1: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is evl.

Frame 2: Same as frame 1.

...

Frame 18: Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is evl.

Frame 19: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — not a kill.

Frame 20: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

Frame 22: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — killer is Clove.

Frame 23: Same as frame 22.

Frame 24: Same.

Frame 25: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is evl.

Frame 26: Same as frame 25.

Frame 27: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — killer is Clove.

Frame 28: Same as frame 27.

Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — killer is Clove.

But these are broadcasts or ability charges, not kills.

Wait, perhaps there's a kill in frame 1. Let's check frame 1:

Player is shooting an enemy. The kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — if "evl" is the enemy, then the player is the killer. But the kill feed shows "evl" as the killer, so that's not the case.

Wait, no. If the player is the killer, then the kill feed should show the player's name as the killer.

So if the player's name is "Me", then the kill feed entry would be "Me (gun) Victim".

In the frames, I don't see any entry where the killer is "Me".

Wait, let's check frame 19: the player's health is 87, and they have a knife. The kill feed shows "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — that's an ability charge.

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — another ability charge.

Frame 29: The kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — but "Clove" is the player's name, so this is a kill.

Wait, but "Eliminated - Team" suggests that the player (Clove) eliminated someone in the Team. But in Valorant, you don't kill teammates; that's a mistake. So maybe this is a kill of an enemy.

Wait, perhaps the kill feed entry "Clove Eliminated - Team" is a kill by the player.

Let's count all such entries.

Looking at the frames:

- Frame 29: Kill feed entry "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

But are there others?

Wait, let's list all kill feed entries where the killer is Clove:

Frame 0: Broadcast, no.

Frame 10: Broadcast.

Frame 11: Broadcast.

Frame 22: Broadcast.

Frame 23: Broadcast.

Frame 24: Broadcast.

Frame 27: Broadcast.

Frame 28: Broadcast.

Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — kill.

But also, in frame 29, is there a kill?

Wait, the player is moving, and the kill feed shows "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this could be a kill.

Are there any other kill feed entries with "Clove" as the killer?

Let's check frame 19: the kill feed entry is "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — no.

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — no.

Frame 25: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is evl.

Frame 26: same as frame 25.

Frame 27: Broadcast.

Frame 28: Broadcast.

Frame 29: Kill feed entry "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

But wait, the kill feed entry "Clove Eliminated - Team" — the "Eliminated" part is when the victim is eliminated, so "Clove" is the killer, "Team" is the victim.

But "Team" is the team, so it's possible that this is a kill of an enemy.

Now, how many times does the player's name (Clove) appear as the killer in the kill feed?

Wait, in the kill feed, when the player kills an enemy, the kill feed entry will show the player's name as the killer.

Looking at all frames:

- In frame 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28: the kill feed entries are either "evl Eliminated - Team" or broadcast.

- In frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

But is there another kill?

Wait, frame 19: the player is using an ability (Blade Storm), which is Clove's ultimate.

Wait, the kill feed entry "Blade Storm X ULT READY" is just an ability charge, not a kill.

Now, let's check when the player actually kills an enemy.

In frame 2, the player is shooting. The kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — if this is a kill by the player, then the killer should be the player's name.

But the killer's name in the kill feed is "evl", which is an enemy.

Wait, no. If the player (Clove) kills an enemy (say, "evl"), then the kill feed entry would be "Clove (gun) evl".

But in the kill feed entries, it's shown as "evl Eliminated - Team" — so "evl" is the victim, and "Team" is the killer.

Wait, the kill feed format is [killer] [weapon] [victim].

So if the killer is "Clove", then it's "Clove (gun) victim".

If the victim is "evl", then "Clove (gun) evl".

But in the kill feed entries, it's shown as "evl Eliminated - Team" — so "evl" is the victim, and "Team" is the killer.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let's think.

In Valorant, the kill feed entries are:

- For example, if Clove kills Osamu with a Vandal, the kill feed entry would be "Clove (Vandal) Osamu".

So the left side is the killer (Clove), the middle is the weapon (Vandal), the right side is the victim (Osamu).

In the frames, the kill feed entries in the top-right corner are shown as [killer] [weapon] [victim].

Looking at frame 2: kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — but "Eliminated" is the action. So "evl" is the victim, "Team" is the killer.

But this doesn't make sense. Maybe "evl Eliminated" means "evl" is the victim, and the killer is "Team" (the team).

But the player is playing for the team, so if the player is on the team, then "Team" would be the killer.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: look for the kill feed entries where the player's name is the killer.

The player's name is in the top-right corner. For example, in frame 0, the player's name is "Me", and the kill feed entries have names like "Clove" and "evl".

But in the kill feed, when the player kills an enemy, the entry should show the player's name as the killer.

Let's check frame 19: the kill feed shows "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — this is an ability charge.

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — same.

Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

But wait, how many actual kills are there?

Let's count the number of kill feed entries where the killer is the player.

In the frames, the kill feed entries are:

- Broadcasts (e.g., "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A") — not kills.

- Entries with "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is evl (enemy), so not the player.

- Entries with "Clove Eliminated - Team" — killer is Clove (player), so this is a kill.

Are there any other entries where the killer is Clove?

Let's check frame 29:

The kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team".

But also, let's check frame 29: the player is in the area, and the kill feed shows "Clove Eliminated - Team".

But is this the only kill?

Wait, another way: when the player kills an enemy, the health bar of the enemy drops to 0, and the kill feed entry appears.

In the clip, let's check when the player's health decreases or when enemies die.

Wait, in frame 19, the player's health is 87, then in frame 20 it's 70 (health decreased), so the player took damage. That means the player was shot by an enemy.

Frame 19: health 87 → frame 20: health 70 → enemy shot the player.

So the player is not making a kill here.

Frame 2: the player is shooting an enemy, and the kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — but this would mean the player's health is decreasing, but in frame 2, the player's health is 100 (no, in frame 2 the health is 100, because the player is not taking damage yet).

Wait, the health is shown in the bottom-left corner. In frame 0, health is 100. In frame 19, health is 87. So between frame 0 and frame 19, the player took damage.

But the kill feed entries are for kills made.

Let's look for the kill feed entries that indicate a kill.

In frame 19, the kill feed shows "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — this is the player charging an ability.

In frame 21, the kill feed shows "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — ability charged.

In frame 29, the kill feed shows "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

But how many times does this happen?

Wait, the problem states to count all unique entries where the player's name is on the left.

So if the player's name is Clove, then any kill feed entry with "Clove" on the left is a kill.

Looking at the kill feed entries:

- Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — Clove is the killer → count as 1.

Are there others?

Let's check frame 1:

Kill feed entry: "evl Eliminated - Team" — evl is the killer → not the player.

Frame 2:

Same as frame 1 → not the player.

...

Frame 28:

Kill feed entry: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — broadcast, not a kill.

Frame 29:

Kill feed entry: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — kill.

Is there another kill feed entry where Clove is the killer?

Looking at frame 19: "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — not a kill.

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — not a kill.

No, only frame 29 has Clove as the killer in a kill feed entry.

Wait, but in frame 29, is the kill feed entry indicating a kill or just a broadcast?

The entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — "Eliminated" implies the victim is eliminated, so it's a kill.

But let's check the frames again.

Wait, in frame 29, the player's weapon is a knife (as per the HUD), but the kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team".

Wait, perhaps the player made a kill in frame 29.

But how many times?

Wait, let's count all kill feed entries where the left side is the player's name.

The player's name is Clove.

Looking at the kill feed entries:

- "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — this is a broadcast, not a kill.

- "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

How many times does "Clove Eliminated - Team" appear?

In the frames:

Frame 29: appears once.

Any others?

Let's check frame 29: yes, it's the only time.

But wait, in frame 29, the kill feed entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team", and this is the only kill feed entry with Clove as the killer.

But wait, in frame 27, the kill feed entry is "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — not a kill.

Frame 28: same.

So only one kill feed entry where the player (Clove) is the killer.

Wait, but let's check the kill feed entries in the frames.

Another possibility: the player killed an enemy in frame 1.

In frame 1, the kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — but this could be the player's kill, but the killer is shown as evl.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let's list all kill feed entries and check:

Frame 0: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 1: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 2: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 3: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 4: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 5: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 6: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 7: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 8: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 9: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 10: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 11: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 12: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 13: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 14: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 15: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 16: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 17: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 18: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 19: "Blade Storm X ULT READY"

Frame 20: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED"

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED"

Frame 22: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 23: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 24: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 25: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 26: "evl Eliminated - Team"

Frame 27: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 28: "Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A"

Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team"

Now, the kill feed entries where the killer is the player's name:

- Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" → killer is Clove → kill count 1.

Are there any other entries where the killer is Clove?

In the list above, only frame 29 has "Clove" as the killer in a kill feed entry.

Wait, but in frame 29, the entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this is a kill.

So the player made 1 kill.

But wait, let's check the round.

The round score is 9-8, so the player is in a round where the score is 9-8.

But the kill feed entries should show kills.

Wait, but in the frames, when the player kills an enemy, the kill feed entry should be visible.

Looking at frame 19, the player is shooting, and the kill feed entry is "Blade Storm X ULT READY" — no kill.

Frame 20: health is 70, so the player took damage (someone shot the player), which means the player was hit by an enemy.

Frame 21: "SIGNATURE ABILITY CHARGED" — no kill.

Frame 22: health is 70, so the player is still taking damage.

Frame 23: health is 70.

Frame 24: health is 70.

Frame 25: health is 70.

Frame 26: health is 70.

Frame 27: health is 70.

Frame 28: health is 70.

Frame 29: health is 70.

So the player is taking damage from an enemy, meaning they're being shot, but not killing anyone.

Wait, but the kill feed entry "Clove Eliminated - Team" — this might be a kill of an enemy.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the player killed an enemy in frame 1.

Let's check frame 1:

Player is shooting at an enemy, and the kill feed entry is "evl Eliminated - Team" — so "evl" is eliminated by "Team" (the player's team).

But the player's name is "Me", so "Team" includes the player.

So if the player's team is "Team", then "Team" is the killer.

But in the kill feed, the killer's name is "Team", so the player is not the killer.

This is confusing.

Alternative approach: count the number of kill feed entries where the killer's name is the player's name.

The player's name is in the top-right corner. In frame 0, the player's name is "Me", and the kill feed entries have names like "Clove" and "evl".

But "Me" is the player's name, so any kill feed entry where the killer is "Me" is a kill.

Looking at the kill feed entries:

- Frame 0: "(Broadcast) Clove (Clove) spotted an ENEMY in A" — killer is Clove.

- Frame 1: "evl Eliminated - Team" — killer is evl.

- Frame 2: same as frame 1.

...

- Frame 29: "Clove Eliminated - Team" — killer is Clove.

So if the player's name is "Me", but the kill feed entries have "Clove" as the killer, then "Clove" is the player's name.

Therefore, any kill feed entry with "Clove" as the killer is a kill by the player.

Looking at the kill feed entries:

- Only frame 29 has "Clove" as the killer in a kill feed entry ("Clove Eliminated - Team").

Therefore, the player made 1 kill.

But wait, in frame 29, the entry is "Clove Eliminated - Team" — does this mean the player killed someone?

Yes, because "Clove" is the killer, so the player (Clove) killed the victim.

Therefore, the count is 1.

Wait, but let's check the round score. The round is 9-8, so there are 9 kills for the team and 8 for the other team.

The kill feed entries show kills made by the player.

Wait, the kill feed entry "Clove Eliminated - Team" — the victim is "Team" (a teammate), which would mean the player killed a teammate, which is not possible in Valorant (unless it's a mistake). So perhaps "Team" is a typo for an enemy.

Alternatively, the kill feed entry might be "Clove (gun) Enemy", so "Clove Eliminated - Enemy".

But in the frames, it's shown as "Clove Eliminated - Team".

Perhaps "Team" is the enemy team, so it's a valid kill.

In any case, the kill feed entry where the player's name is on the left is counted as a kill.

So only frame 29 has the player's name on the left as the killer.

Therefore, the count is 1.
